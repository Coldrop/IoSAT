# Security Challenges in the Internet of Satellites (IoSat)

## Overview

This repository contains my academic research on **security and operational challenges** in **Internet of Satellites (IoSat)** networks.

The study examines:

- How satellite systems communicate
- Where vulnerabilities emerge
- How modern security mechanisms could be adapted to space-based environments

## Research Scope

- Analysis of **peer-to-peer satellite communication** and **Inter-Satellite Networks (ISNs)**
- Evaluation of operational constraints such as:
  - Latency
  - Limited onboard computation
  - Environmental exposure (radiation, temperature extremes, etc.)
- Identification of **IoSat attack surfaces** and potential **threat vectors**

## Security Approaches Reviewed

- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**
- **Blockchain-based** trust and consensus mechanisms
- **Machine Learning–based** threat detection

## Conclusion

This is a **theoretical research project** focused on:

- Analysing risks in satellite mega-constellations and IoSat architectures
- Evaluating whether advanced security technologies are realistically deployable in **resource-constrained satellite systems**

## Status

**Academic research project** – literature review and security analysis
